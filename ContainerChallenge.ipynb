    "# Welcome to the DISCOVER Hack Shack Container Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you attend or watch the following recorded Discover Hack Shack Workshops before attempting this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Hack Shack Workshop: Git 101](../WKSHP-GIT101/1-WKSHP-GIT-Basics.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Hack Shack Workshop: Streamline app development with open source Grommet](../WKSHP-Grommet/1-WKSHP-Introduction.ipynb)\n",
    "3. [Hack Shack W480: API 101 - API basics and the value they provide](../WKSHP-API101/1-WKSHP-API-Basics.ipynb)\n",
    "4. [Hack Shack W479: Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API](../WKSHP-HPECP-API/1-WKSHP-HPECP-IntroAndAuth.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also make sure you leverage the notebooks provided in your Jupyter account environment for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Please note, your account session will only be allocated for a 4-hour time slot, so make sure you register only when you have enough time available to take the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Build a sample front-end application\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to accomplish this challenge is to create a sample front-end application. For this, we would like you to use Grommet. Keep it simple. All we really need is a sample app with a web interface. If you need help, the Grommet Workshop is your best point of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quizz question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    ">What is the URL of the Grommet designer: `Your response goes here`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Run your web application locally\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step will be to make your sample application run locally on your machine. This is described in great detail in the Grommet Workshop, so please make use of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Containerize your application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, you will make your application run locally in a container. This is the trickiest piece as it's not described in any workshop, butwe will guide you through it. This step requires that you have Docker installed on your machine. (If you need Docker  follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to to download it onto your work environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Docker runs, you can use the following `Dockerfile` (also provided in the repo) to package your application in a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "FROM node\n",
    " \n",
    "RUN mkdir /app\n",
    "# set working directory\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    " \n",
    "# add `/app/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH\n",
    "ENV PATH /app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH\n",
    " \n",
    "# install and cache app dependencies\n",
    "COPY package.json /app/package.json\n",
    " \n",
    "RUN npm install --silent\n",
    " \n",
    "COPY . .\n",
    "# Application port\n",
    "EXPOSE 3000\n",
    " \n",
    "# Remote debugging port\n",
    "EXPOSE 9229\n",
    " \n",
    "# start app\n",
    "CMD [\"npm\", \"start\"]\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this `Dockerfile`, create a container image for your application. Once the image is created, test your application, by launching a container from that image and connecting to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Upload container in DockerHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have built your container using the provided Dockerfile (and docker build), and tested it, you will need to tag your image (with docker tag) to prepare it for uploading  on your DockerHub account (If you do not have a DockerHub account yet, create one [here](https://hub.docker.com/)). Once you are logged in your DockerHub account, create an empty repository for your container image. Then upload your container image to your repository (using docker push).\n",
    "\n",
    "Check [this article](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/) for more details about docker push if you need additional help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quizz Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the URL of your container image repository on Docker: `Your response goes here`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Make your application run in a Kubernetes environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final step of the challenge. We will ask you to use the containerized version of your application in a Kubernetes environment managed by HPE Container Platform. To do this, you will create a resource file (in YAML) that will create the necessary Kubernetes artifacts to run the Docker image of your application in our K8S cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these instructions from the \"Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API\" notebook to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Login to HPE Container Platform\n",
    "2. Retrieve a valid kubeconfig file\n",
    "3. Define your KUBECONFIG environment variable\n",
    "4. Use kubectl to manage your K8S Cluster\n",
    "5. Create a my-app.yaml file that declares a **deployment** and a **service** for your application container image\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a hint. First try to get your application to run in the K8S Cluster using `kubectl run -i -t` and then use `kubectl get pod -o yaml` to extract the corresponding YAML file. Make sure you use unique names for artifacts so it doesn't conflict with other challengers (for example, by appending your name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your YAML file is committed to the repo as this is going to be the most important part of your response (together with responses to the Quiz)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your application runs in a K8S pod, connect to it over its public address. Carefully follow the instructions from the \"Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API\" workshop to find out the external IP/port number of your running application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quizz Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the URL of your pod on the public network: `Your response goes here`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finished? Well done! It's now time to submit your reponse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting your response \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to submit your response to this challenge, we will ask you to use GitHub to submit the modified version of the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "Follow instructions from the \"GIT101\" notebook if you need help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commit your changes to local repo\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Launcher->Terminal session, commit changes locally \n",
    "\n",
    "### Push your changes to your GitHub account\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Launcher->Terminal session, push your changes to your Github account. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From your repo, submit a pull request to Challenge repo\n",
    "\n",
    "It's now time to submit your response back to the HPE Discover Challenge Repo. To do so, we ask you to submit a Pull Request (PR) from your GitHub account. Make sure you provide an email in the description of the PR so we can find you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wait for jury and/or try another challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "We will select one winner per challenge. Stay tuned for the announcement at the end of HPE Discover Virtual Experience. There will also be a drawing amongst everyone who completed  all of our challenges, so... back to work! :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Congratulations for completing this Challenge!\n"
